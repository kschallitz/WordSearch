# WordSearch
Python program to generate your own word search

My kids love to do word searches, so I've created a Python3 application that can read a list of words from a file or a URL. 
It will then place the words into a matrix of letters (i.e., a word search grid)

The program will automatically weed out any duplicate words. Provides a list of all words that were fit into the matrix,
and displays the matrix. All you need to do is hit <CTRL>-P to print your puzzle!
